# FNaF Desktop Monitor

Ever wanted two screens, but were too broke to afford one? Well, this does pretty much that, except with the monitor from FNaF. Why the monitor from FNaF? What, do you have something against FNaF? Might be on the files but at least it's a good game.
I highly suggest you DON'T open two up at the same time, since it's not rlly meant for that.
Basically what this does is create a new desktop for you, and make it easily accessible with a top button.
Once the program is closed, the new desktop will be deleted.
To close the program, check the trays, there should be one for the program.
